Detecting Anomalies in Multivariate Time Series Data using Facebook (Meta) Prophet Algorithm

<br>
<i>&emsp; &emsp; Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points, observations or events which deviate from normal behaviour. Analysing Time-series data would help recognise the root cause of various trends or patterns that have surfaced over time. This is essential because the subsequent value in time-series data depends on the input from the previous value. Here we are detecting anomalies in time-series data using Facebook Prophet, an open-source library available for forecasting using R or Python.
<br>&emsp; &emsp; Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality along with holiday effects. It functions best with time-series data that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is stringent to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well. Here, we shall be applying the same on Real Ad Exchange dataset, which shows online advertisement clicking rates, where the metrics are cost-per-click (CPC) and cost-per thousand impressions (CPM).</i>
